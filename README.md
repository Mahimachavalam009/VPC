Amazon VPC


# What is a VPC?
If we imagine your AWS Region as a country, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like your own private city inside that country.
You can design neighborhoods (known as subnets, which you'll learn about in this project), traffic rules, and security measures to control how resources, like EC2 instances and databases, connect and work together.
